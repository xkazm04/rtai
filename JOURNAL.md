# JOURNAL - lane visual-engine (n-visual)

## 2026-11-02 iteration 2 BUILD (21:08 -> 22:38)
- Worktree was fresh (no JOURNAL from iteration 1 here). Copied the native DLLs from the f04-core
  worktree (native/ unchanged since b2c5b8b), imported, baked the 256 chunks.
- Baseline frames: `gtai-masters/night/visual-engine/00-baseline/selftest-{32,48}ppm.png` (city_selftest,
  seed 91, junction riot, RTX 4090 d3d12).
- MILESTONE item 1: render layer stack as data. `data/tables/render_layers.json` (gtai.render-layers/1)
  + schema, `core/render/render_layers.gd` (canvas()/z()/audit()), `core/render/README.md`. ChunkView now
  splits each chunk into 5 bands x 4 quadrants (ground, decals, building shadows, props, roofs), CrowdLayers
  uses bands (shadows 0, people 100, vehicles 200, bullets fx 400), rigs at the people band.
  Test `tests/unit/test_render_layers.gd` 5/5 (builds the real city scene and audits it).
  After frames `01-layers/`: cars above people now; rigs no longer under the crowd/cars.
- Item 7 (cheap rig fix) landed early: CityCharacters skips the whole rig pass (feed + select + pose)
  on frames with no sim tick. Not yet measured (bench pending).
- Bench (exported release, 1 run x 30 s, after the rig skip): p99 2.61 ms, 1% low 268 fps; rigs p50 0 /
  p99 0.559 ms per frame (riot, 16 rigs). FRICTION: the skip removes the no-tick frames (p50 -> 0) but
  the p99 is a tick frame and is unchanged vs lane A's 0.57-0.59: the 0.3 ms target is NOT met.
  Next lever: spread the half-rate rigs / move selection to every other tick. evidence/bench-*.json.
- MILESTONE item 2: look profiles as data. `data/tables/look_profiles.json` (gtai.look-profiles/1) with
  d1/d4/d5 rows of every print uniform (+ item uniforms + parts_flat_below), default `auto` = d4 to
  48 px/m, smoothstep to d5 at 64. `-- --look=<id|auto|off>` (shared file touched: boot/launch_args.gd
  KNOWN_FLAGS + boot/world.gd, 3 lines). look_d4 got a `hatch_period` uniform (4.0 = unchanged).
  Golden frames: dev/selftest/look_golden.gd under --fixed-fps 60, 10 cases, goldens in
  tests/golden/look (320x200, LFS). Two runs bit-identical (mean 0.00). Hooked into tools/selftest/run.mjs
  -> selftest evidence: "look goldens 10/10 within mean 4 (worst 0.00)". Unit 154/154, lint 13/13.
  Frames: gtai-masters/night/visual-engine/02-looks/ (D5@64 visibly darker/grimier than D4@64;
  0 rejected, all straight down). D4 at 32/48 is unchanged by construction (auto = d4 below 48).
