# n8 street: JOURNAL

## Iteration 1 (2026-11-06 20:26, BUILD)

Read: d8 chars/view70 REPORTs, `RigCardSets` / `RigHeadCard`, `tools/art/street_head.py`, library
`catalog.json` (street class). Other lanes: no journals yet at 20:30.

Library state for my classes (keyed/street/): every id has BOTH a 55 and a 70 sheet already.
70 grades: cop_riot A, cop_patrol B, swat B, thug A, contractor A, cultist B, torque_gang A,
peds A except ped_suit B, ped_cap B. So no 70-twin REQUEST is needed for the cops (brief step 1
asked for it; the asset lane served it at 19:40/20:40).

REQUEST to view: a street registration hook for the card rows. `RigCardSets.SETS` is yours; I need
my own file `project/features/characters/street_card_sets.gd` (class `StreetCardSets`, const
`SETS: Dictionary[String, Dictionary]`, same row shape as `RigCardSets.SETS`) to be merged by
`RigHeadCard.rows_of(art)` AFTER `SET_CARDS[art]` (street rows win for the keys they name). Then
drop the p55/p70 street rows (`cop/*`, `ped/*`, `thug`) from `RigCardSets.SETS` or leave them: mine
override. One line in `rows_of`: `for key in StreetCardSets.SETS.get(art, {}): ...` (the same loop
as SET_CARDS). Until it lands I film with that loop as an uncommitted local patch and say so.
