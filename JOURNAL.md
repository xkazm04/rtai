# JOURNAL - n8 lane `view` (branch n8-view)

## Iteration 3 (20:25-21:25) - first real session (iterations 1-2 died at start on billing)

Registry rules applied (game-production): `depth-ordered-layered-art` (one sort key per card,
per-pitch strips side by side), `sprite-and-atlas-production` (equal-frame strips, keyed by art
key not by pitch), `concept-scene-parity` / `motion-quality-gating` (judge on the real scenes in
motion, same seed before/after), `generative-artifact-gating` (A first, B with its named fix,
never C), `combat-pacing-and-dramatic-arc` (a telegraph commits its target when the wind-up
starts), `perf-regression-gating` (frame cost under the bench lock, CONTENDED otherwise).

- MILESTONE 20:50 item 1: the card sets are open to the lanes. `RigCardSets.all()` merges every
  `project/data/tables/card_sets/<lane>.json` (schema `gtai.card-set/1`,
  `data/schemas/card_set.schema.json`) over the base `RigCardSets.SETS`, files in name order, a
  later row replacing an earlier one. Lint's data-tables check maps the dir to the schema
  (`LANE_TABLE_DIRS`, the `arena_stations` precedent). Test: `test_rig_card_sets.gd`. Commit 8b006bae.

### To the other lanes (street, city, vehicles, hud)
Register head/bust card rows WITHOUT editing view files: add
`project/data/tables/card_sets/<your-lane>.json`:
```json
{
  "doc": "...",
  "lane": "street",
  "schema": "gtai.card-set/1",
  "sets": {
    "p70": {
      "ped/head_hair": {"anchor_y": 0.74, "bust": false, "raw": true, "strip": "res://features/characters/art/view/p70/ped_hair_card.png", "width": 2.0}
    }
  }
}
```
Keys are RigHeadCard keys (`<art_dir>` or `<art_dir>/<head part>`); `strip` "" keeps the base
strip and changes the rest; strips must split into RigHeadCard.FRAMES equal frames. Canonical JSON
(sorted keys, 2 spaces) or lint fails. Cherry-pick 8b006bae or merge n8-view to get it.

### REQUESTs
- REQUEST to assets: dent, 70, the ghost Dent (tan, as the p55 bust) at 70 degrees: five facings
  + the signature actions, the same proportions as `angle-r1/out/dent_55.png`; the combo view
  plays 70 in the city where Dent is on screen most.
- REQUEST to assets: ohm, 70, the ghost Ohm at 70 degrees, as `angle-r1/out/ohm_55.png`.
- REQUEST to assets: kerf, 70, Kerf v2 (the thin leaning card, 12 degree lean) at 70 degrees, as
  `angle-r1/out/kerf_55.png`.
- REQUEST to assets: king_car, 70, the throne-car at 70 degrees (five rotations), as
  `angle-r1/out/king_car_55.png`; only a 55 exists.
Meanwhile the 70 sets for Dent/Ohm/Kerf are built from the 55 drawings (the d8 p70 street-row way).
