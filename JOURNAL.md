# JOURNAL - lane visual-engine (n-visual)

## 2026-11-02 iteration 2 BUILD (21:08 -> 22:38)
- Worktree was fresh (no JOURNAL from iteration 1 here). Copied the native DLLs from the f04-core
  worktree (native/ unchanged since b2c5b8b), imported, baked the 256 chunks.
- Baseline frames: `gtai-masters/night/visual-engine/00-baseline/selftest-{32,48}ppm.png` (city_selftest,
  seed 91, junction riot, RTX 4090 d3d12).
- MILESTONE item 1: render layer stack as data. `data/tables/render_layers.json` (gtai.render-layers/1)
  + schema, `core/render/render_layers.gd` (canvas()/z()/audit()), `core/render/README.md`. ChunkView now
  splits each chunk into 5 bands x 4 quadrants (ground, decals, building shadows, props, roofs), CrowdLayers
  uses bands (shadows 0, people 100, vehicles 200, bullets fx 400), rigs at the people band.
  Test `tests/unit/test_render_layers.gd` 5/5 (builds the real city scene and audits it).
  After frames `01-layers/`: cars above people now; rigs no longer under the crowd/cars.
- Item 7 (cheap rig fix) landed early: CityCharacters skips the whole rig pass (feed + select + pose)
  on frames with no sim tick. Not yet measured (bench pending).
- Bench (exported release, 1 run x 30 s, after the rig skip): p99 2.61 ms, 1% low 268 fps; rigs p50 0 /
  p99 0.559 ms per frame (riot, 16 rigs). FRICTION: the skip removes the no-tick frames (p50 -> 0) but
  the p99 is a tick frame and is unchanged vs lane A's 0.57-0.59: the 0.3 ms target is NOT met.
  Next lever: spread the half-rate rigs / move selection to every other tick. evidence/bench-*.json.
- MILESTONE item 2: look profiles as data. `data/tables/look_profiles.json` (gtai.look-profiles/1) with
  d1/d4/d5 rows of every print uniform (+ item uniforms + parts_flat_below), default `auto` = d4 to
  48 px/m, smoothstep to d5 at 64. `-- --look=<id|auto|off>` (shared file touched: boot/launch_args.gd
  KNOWN_FLAGS + boot/world.gd, 3 lines). look_d4 got a `hatch_period` uniform (4.0 = unchanged).
  Golden frames: dev/selftest/look_golden.gd under --fixed-fps 60, 10 cases, goldens in
  tests/golden/look (320x200, LFS). Two runs bit-identical (mean 0.00). Hooked into tools/selftest/run.mjs
  -> selftest evidence: "look goldens 10/10 within mean 4 (worst 0.00)". Unit 154/154, lint 13/13.
  Frames: gtai-masters/night/visual-engine/02-looks/ (D5@64 visibly darker/grimier than D4@64;
  0 rejected, all straight down). D4 at 32/48 is unchanged by construction (auto = d4 below 48).
- MILESTONE item 3: colour doctrine. `data/tables/palette.json` (gtai.palette/1): base tokens, the two
  accents with allowed uses + allowed render layers, classifier gates = look_d4 plates(). `core/render/
  palette_tokens.gd` (classify, allowed, count_accents). `dev/selftest/accent_audit.gd`: per-layer accent
  pixel counts by hiding layers with the tree paused; in the selftest evidence (non-gating).
  Result: vermilion 0.95 % of frame at 32/48 px/m, 0.26 % at 64, all on actors (cops). Teal 0-4 px.
  OFFENDER (asset, for d4-production): `features/city/art/props/traffic_light.png` - its 3 red lamps print
  on the vermilion plate in the world (216 px at 32 px/m). Suggest ink/paper lamps (or an unlit grey).
  Crop: gtai-masters/night/visual-engine/03-accents/world-offender-crop.png.
  Also noted: CityTextures.PLACEHOLDER["prop"] is a warm orange (0.75,0.45,0.3) - below the gate today
  (r-max(g,b) = 0.30 < 0.31) but one tweak from printing vermilion; no placeholder prop on screen now.
- MILESTONE item 4: 2D lighting. `data/tables/lights.json` (gtai.lights/1: 5 kinds, day/night grades,
  max_lights 32), `core/render/light_layer.gd` + `light_pool.gd`, `assets/shaders/light_ink.gdshader`.
  CityView owns a LightLayer stepped on the sim clock (CityCharacters sets view.clock). render_layers:
  `light` canvas -> screen space with bands grade 0 / lights 100. Test test_light_layer 4/4.
  Frames: 04-lights (stipple edges: read as halftone glow - REPLACED), 04b-lights-hatch (hatched band
  edges: read as drawn rings - kept). 0 frames rejected (all straight down).
  Cost: CPU step 70-168 us. GPU NOT reliably measured: deltas +1.32/+0.05/+0.09/-0.87 ms across 4 runs
  (FRICTION: the d5 lane renders on the same GPU at the same time).
  BLOCKED-ish: no positional shot/explosion events exist in Events; lights are API + dev driver only.
- DEVIATION logged: chunks now 20 canvas items (5 bands x 4 quadrants) vs the §20 "8 per chunk" row.
