# JOURNAL - lane visual-engine (n-visual)

## 2026-11-02 iteration 2 BUILD (21:08 -> 22:38)
- Worktree was fresh (no JOURNAL from iteration 1 here). Copied the native DLLs from the f04-core
  worktree (native/ unchanged since b2c5b8b), imported, baked the 256 chunks.
- Baseline frames: `gtai-masters/night/visual-engine/00-baseline/selftest-{32,48}ppm.png` (city_selftest,
  seed 91, junction riot, RTX 4090 d3d12).
- MILESTONE item 1: render layer stack as data. `data/tables/render_layers.json` (gtai.render-layers/1)
  + schema, `core/render/render_layers.gd` (canvas()/z()/audit()), `core/render/README.md`. ChunkView now
  splits each chunk into 5 bands x 4 quadrants (ground, decals, building shadows, props, roofs), CrowdLayers
  uses bands (shadows 0, people 100, vehicles 200, bullets fx 400), rigs at the people band.
  Test `tests/unit/test_render_layers.gd` 5/5 (builds the real city scene and audits it).
  After frames `01-layers/`: cars above people now; rigs no longer under the crowd/cars.
- Item 7 (cheap rig fix) landed early: CityCharacters skips the whole rig pass (feed + select + pose)
  on frames with no sim tick. Not yet measured (bench pending).
